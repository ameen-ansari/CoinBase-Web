            The next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending
            ports. This could be a place close to home and sail in one area or
            start and finish at two different ports. Generally, starting and
            stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more
            convenient. You can also fly to a destination far from home and then
            sail another exotic sea. There are luxury yacht charter companies
            that cruise the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas or around Alaska,
            the Panama Canal, or anyplace you can imagine.

            Determining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a
            chartered yachting trip. You can have as little or many crew members
            as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries out of
            navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a real vacation
            that rivals the finest hotel services. You can also choose to have a
            chef and service crew as part of your vacation package.

                If you like the idea of knowing what it is really like to sail,
                but don’t want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise
                that puts you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will
                direct you as to your “chores” for keeping the ship in top shape
                and on course.

                Destinations & Ports of important Charter Companies One of the
                greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation
                is the choice. You will most likely have a rough itinerary and
                that can be affected by weather. However, you are flexible in
                deciding how long you want to stay in a particular port and if
                you want to add or subtract stops along the way.

            Your yacht is your hotel that travels with you. There is only one
            flight and one hotel to book! Then you take all of your luggage and
            unpack it just once to enjoy several days of new destinations.

            If you have never experienced cruising before, a chartered
            experience is a great way to get your feet wet. It is different from
            cruise lines with thousands of guests because the people on your
            ship will be your friends and family. The personal touches of a
            chartered trip will help you develop your love for the sea with all
            the best benefits of commercial cruises.
